  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm an aspiring web developer with the goal of starting my own web development business. I believe a website is a great tool for any business, especially small local businesses and startups. My goal is to help these businesses grow by equipping them with beatiful websites </p>


<p>When I'm not working on web programming I try to find time for all my hobbies. I really enjoy anime/ manga, some of my favorites being Kenichi: The Mighiest Disciple, and Dragon Ball Z. I also enjoy resin crafting. I dream of owning my own business making resin items and selling them through an online store and at anime/gaming conventions.</p>

<p>I also enjoy music, who doesn't right? My favorite bands include Dragonforce, Nightwish, and Igorrr. I try to go to as many concerts as I can to support the bands I love.</p>

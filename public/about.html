<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I, Brandon Ogden, born on June 21st, am a very smart boy. I can do just about anything when it comes to I.T. 
  Hence where my dreams of being a web developer come from. I am also really strong, being able to deadlift 325 lbs.</p>


<p>I have many interest, I really enjoy anime/ manga, some of my favorites being Kenichi and Dragon Ball Z. 
  Some may say having Dragon Ball Z has a favorite anime is basic but what can I say it's good. I also enjoy resin, I dream of owning my own business making resin items. 
  I also enjoy music, who doesn't right? My favorite bands include Dragonforce, Nightwish, and Igorrr.</p>


<p>Along with being the coolest person in the world, I have the coolest girlfriend in the world. One day we will be married and I will show her all my web designing projects. 
  I will also carry her everywhere she wants to go, and we will watch Kenichi together. Then we will make resin fish together and go to a concert of Igorrr and Dragonforce.</p>
